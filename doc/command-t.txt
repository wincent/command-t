INTRODUCTION                                    *command-t-intro*

The Command-T plug-in provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for
opening files and buffers with a minimal number of keystrokes. It's named
"Command-T" because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window bound to
Command-T in TextMate.

Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and are
ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in certain
locations (for example, immediately after a path separator) should be given
more weight.

To search efficiently, especially in large projects, you should adopt a
"path-centric" rather than a "filename-centric" mentality. That is you should
think more about where the desired file is found rather than what it is
called. This means narrowing your search down by including some characters
from the upper path components rather than just entering characters from the
filename itself.


REQUIREMENTS                                    *command-t-requirements*

The core of Command-T is written in C for speed, and it optionally makes use
of a number of external programs -- such as `git`, `rg`, and `watchman` --
for finding files.

Run `:checkhealth wincent.commandt` to confirm that the C library has been
built, and check for the presence of the optional executable helpers.

See also |command-t-ruby-requirements| for older requirements.


INSTALLATION                                    *command-t-installation*

You'll need a C compiler. `cd` into the `lua/wincent/commandt/lib/` directory
and type:
>
    make
<
See also |command-t-ruby-installation| for older installation instructions
(relevant if you wish to continue using the Ruby implementation as a
fallback, as described in |command-t-upgrading| below).


UPGRADING                                       *command-t-upgrading*

This section details what has changed from version 5.x to 6.x, why, and how to
update. For additional context see the blog post:

  https://wincent.com/blog/command-t-lua-rewrite

Up to and including version 5.0, Command-T was written in a combination of
Ruby, Vimscript, and C, and was compatible with a range of versions of both
Vim and Neovim. Back when the project started (2010), Vim was at version 7 and
Neovim did not exist yet. At that time, Ruby provided a convenient means of
packaging high-performance C code inside a library that could be called from
Vim, making Command-T the fastest fuzzy-finder by far. The downside was that
it was hard to install because it required that care be taken to compile both
Vim and Command-T with the exact same version of Ruby. Additionally, Vim did
not yet provide handy abstractions for things like floating windows, which
meant that a large fraction of the Command-T codebase was actually dedicated
to micromanaging windows, buffers and splits, so that it could create the
illusion of rendering a separate match listing interface without interfering
with existing buffers, splits, and settings. Most of this code was written in
Ruby (a "real" programming language), which was a bit more pleasant to work
with than Vimscript (infamous for its quirks), but the design was still fairly
unorthodox; for example, the decision to capture query inputs by setting up
mappings for individual keys (given that there was no actual input buffer)
meant that some things that you might reasonably expect to work, like being
able to copy and paste a query, did not always work.

Since then, a number of things have occurred: competitive pressure from Neovim
has lead to a proliferation of features in both editors, including floating
windows which make building plug-in UIs like the one needed by Command-T
much easier than before. While Vim has doubled down on its bespoke scripting
language in the form of "Vim9 script", Neovim has leveraged Lua, which is
broadly used across a range of technology ecosystems and offers excellent
performance. Many core editor APIs are now easily accessible from Lua, and for
those that aren't, running pieces of Vimscript from Lua is possible, albeit
ugly. Interestingly, from the perspective of Command-T, interfacing with a
C library from Lua is relatively straightforward due to the excellent FFI
support.

From version 6.0, as the result of a complete rewrite, the core of Command-T
is now written in Lua and C, and it only supports Neovim. The C library is now
pure POSIX-compliant C, free from any references to the Ruby virtual machine.
This, combined with the low overhead of calling into C from Lua via the FFI
means that the performance critical parts of the code are even faster than
before, up to twice as fast according to the benchmarks. In addition, by
targeting newer APIs and writing the UI code in Lua, that portion of the core
is also significantly more responsive and robust. Various UI quirks have been
eliminated in this way, including the aforementioned inability to paste
queries (Command-T uses a real buffer for input now, which means that all
standard Vim editing commands can be used inside the prompt area).

There is a cost, however. Most notably, the rewrite is not yet a
feature-complete copy of the original Ruby-powered version, and filling in
the gaps is dependent on seeing adequate demand from users. Additionally,
as a ground-up rewrite, there is the possibility that new bugs have been
introduced. The other obvious cost is that this is a breaking change, in a
sense. No attempt has been made at providing Windows support for instance, nor
for Vim. In my judgment, Neovim has won the war, and I have no interest in
investing in projects that require me to master a custom programming language
usuable in only one environment.

In recognition of the fact that many plug-in users in the Vim/Neovim ecosystem
use plug-in managers to track the `HEAD` of the default branch of a Git
repository, we can use SemVer (https://semver.org/) but not expect it to serve
much communicative purpose nor shield users from inconvenience. As such, the
initial plan is to keep the Ruby code exactly where it is inside the plug-in
and print a deprecation warning prompting people to either opt-in to continue
using the old implementation, or otherwise opt-in to the new one.


How to opt-in to remaining on the Ruby implementation ~

Set:
>
    let g:CommandTPreferredImplementation='ruby'
<
early on in your |vimrc|, before the Lua code in the plug-in has had a chance
to execute. This will cause the Ruby code to set up its commands, options,
and mappings as it always has done. That is, a command like |:CommandT| will
open the Ruby-powered file finder, and a mapping like `<Leader>t` will trigger
that command. Likewise, options such as |g:CommandTMaxFiles| will continue to
operate as before. The behavior of these commands, options, and mappings is
described in |command-t-ruby.txt| (the bulk of the documentation in this file,
|command-t.txt|, refers to the Lua-powered facilities).

The Lua implementation is still available for testing even when
|g:CommandTPreferredImplementation| is set to `"ruby"`. For example, to use
the Lua-powered version of |:CommandT| when Ruby is selected, invoke the
command with the `:KommandT` alias instead.


How to opt-in to switching to the Lua implementation ~

Call:
>
    require('wincent.commandt').setup()
<
early on in your |vimrc|,  before the Ruby plug-in code has had a chance to
execute. Alternatively, if you wish to defer calling |commandt.setup()| until
later on in the |startup| process, you can instead define early on:
>
    let g:CommandTPreferredImplementation='lua'
<
In order to make a clean break, and avoid confusion about the capabilities
and behavior of the different implementations, the Lua version does not make
any use of the |g:| options variables from the Ruby implementation. That is,
instead of setting a variable like |g:CommandTMaxHeight| to control the height
of the match listing, you would instead pass a `height` value in your
|commandt.setup()| call:
>
    require('wincent.commandt').setup({
      height = 30,
    })
<
Upon opting in to use the Lua implementation, it will set up commands such as
|:CommandT|, |:CommandTBuffer|, and |:CommandTHelp|. As noted previously, not
all commands in the Ruby implementation have equivalents in the Lua
implementation yet.

The Ruby implementation, which continues to exist, will take the call to
|commandt.setup()| as a cue to define alternate versions of its commands under
different aliases, that can be used as a fallback in the event that something
is faulty or insufficient with the Lua versions. For example, the Ruby
versions of the above will be available as `:KommandT`, `:KommandTBuffer`, and
`:KommandTHelp`, respectively. At some point in the future, once the new
version is considered sufficiently stable and complete, these fallbacks
won't be defined any more. Expect that change to be made with the release of
version 7.0.

Unlike the Ruby version, the Lua version does not define any mappings out of
the box. In order to set up the equivalent mappings for Lua, you would add the
following to your |vimrc| or some other file that gets loaded during
|startup|:
>
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>b', '<Plug>(CommandTBuffer)', { remap = true })
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>j', '<Plug>(CommandTJump)', { remap  = true })
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>t', '<Plug>(CommandT)', { remap = true })
<

What happens if you don't explicitly opt-in to either implementation ~

When you open Neovim, Command-T will show a message prompting you to choose an
implementation via one of the above means. You can either follow this prompt,
or ignore it, but it will appear every time that you open Neovim until you
make a decision.

If you don't opt-in explicitly, Command-T version 6.0 will behave as though
you had chosen Ruby. Starting with version 7.0, it will behave as though you
had chosen Lua.

If you are running Vim instead of Neovim, Command-T will behave as though you
had chosen Ruby.

If you wish to avoid the entire business of upgrading, you can set up your
plug-in manager to track the Command-T `5-x-release` branch instead of `main`.
That branch only contains the Ruby code, and none of the Lua changes that
started with the 6.0 release.


TROUBLE-SHOOTING                                *command-t-trouble-shooting*

See also |command-t-ruby-trouble-shooting| for older trouble-shooting tips.


KNOWN ISSUES                                    *command-t-known-issues*

- There are many missing features in 6.x compared with 5.x.
- Prior to 6.x the Watcman scanner would fall back to the `find`-based scanner
  in the event of an error; 6.x does not yet implement any such fallback.
- 5.x used to cache directory listings, requiring the use of |:CommandTFlush|
  to force a re-scan. 6.x does not implement any such caching (which means
  that results are always fresh, but on large directories the re-scanning may
  introduce a noticeable delay).
- Sometimes the results in the match listing are scrolled to the right,
  causing the left edge to be cut off; I would love to fix this but haven't
  identified a cause yet.
- The documentation for 6.x (ie. this document) is still a work in progress.


USAGE                                           *command-t-usage*

See also |command-t-ruby-usage| for older usage information.


COMMANDS                                        *command-t-commands*

                                                *:CommandT*
|:CommandT|         Brings up the Command-T file window, starting in the current
                  working directory as returned by the |:pwd| command. Scans
                  for files using the `fts` facilities provided by the C
                  standard library.

                                                 *:CommandTBuffer*
|:CommandTBuffer|   Brings up the Command-T buffer window.
                  This works exactly like the standard file window,
                  except that the selection is limited to files that
                  you already have open in buffers.

                                                *:CommandTFind*
|:CommandTFind|     Brings up the Command-T file window, starting in the current
                  working directory as returned by the |:pwd| command. Scans
                  for files by executing the `find` executable.

                                                *:CommandTGit*
|:CommandTGit|      Brings up the Command-T file window, starting in the current
                  working directory as returned by the |:pwd| command. Scans
                  for files using `git`, so only works inside Git
                  repositories.

                                                 *:CommandTHelp*
|:CommandTHelp|     Brings up the Command-T help search window. This works
                  exactly like the standard file window, except that it shows
                  help topics found in any documentation under Vim's
                  |'runtimepath'|.

                                                *:CommandTRipgrep*
|:CommandTRipgrep|  Brings up the Command-T file window, starting in the current
                  working directory as returned by the |:pwd| command. Scans
                  for files using `rg`.

                                                *:CommandTWatchman*
|:CommandTWatchman| Brings up the Command-T file window, starting in the current
                  working directory as returned by the |:pwd| command. Scans
                  for files by connecting to the `watchman` daemon, which must
                  be installed on your system.

See also |command-t-ruby-commands| for commands that exist specifically within
the Ruby-powered version of Command-T.


FUNCTIONS                                       *command-t-functions*

All Lua functions defined by Command-T are namespaced under `wincent` in
order to avoid collisions with other plug-ins and with built-in functionality
provided by Neovim. That is, to require and use a function like
|commandt.setup()| you would use a `require` statement like:
>
    require('wincent.commandt').setup()
<
The are a number of private functions that are defined inside the plug-in that
are for internal use only. To make clear where the public/private boundary
falls, all internal functions are nested under `wincent.commandt.private`. As
such, if you were to require one of these, be aware that none of these APIs
are documented and they could change without notice at any time; for example:
>
    local Window = require('wincent.commandt.private.window').Window
<

                                                *commandt.setup()*
|commandt.setup()|
>

Additionally, Hanson Wang, Jacek Wysocki, Kevin Cox, and Yiding Jia wrote
patches which were not directly included but which served as a model for
changes that did end up making it in.

As this was the first Vim plug-in I had ever written I was heavily influenced
by the design of the LustyExplorer plug-in by Stephen Bach, which I understand
was one of the largest Ruby-based Vim plug-ins at the time.

While the Command-T codebase doesn't contain any code directly copied from
LustyExplorer, I did use it as a reference for answers to basic questions (like
"How do you do 'X' in a Ruby-based Vim plug-in?"), and also copied some basic
architectural decisions (like the division of the code into Prompt, Settings
and MatchWindow classes).

DEVELOPMENT                                     *command-t-development*

Development in progress can be inspected at:

  https://github.com/wincent/command-t

the clone URL for which is:

  https://github.com/wincent/command-t.git

Mirrors exist on GitLab and BitBucket, and are automatically updated once per
hour:

  https://gitlab.com/wincent/command-t
  https://bitbucket.org/ghurrell/command-t

Patches are welcome via the usual mechanisms (pull requests, email, posting to
the project issue tracker etc).

As many users choose to track Command-T using Pathogen or similar, which often
means running a version later than the last official release, the intention is
that the "main" branch should be kept in a stable and reliable state as much
as possible.

Riskier changes are first cooked on the "next" branch for a period
before being merged into "main". You can track this branch if you're
feeling wild and experimental, but note that the "next" branch may
periodically be rewound (force-updated) to keep it in sync with the
"main" branch after each official release.

HISTORY                                         *command-t-history*

main (not yet released) ~

- ...

6.0.0-a.0 (26 August 2022) ~

- Rewrite in Lua; for more details see |command-t-upgrading|. Note that this
  is an alpha release, so the new APIs are subject to change.

5.0.5 (24 July 2022) ~

- Teach watchman scanner to favor `watch-project` over `watch` when
  available (#390, patch from Todd Derr).

5.0.4 (28 May 2022) ~

- Support opening files which contain newlines (#365).
- Guard against possible |E315| on accepting a selection.
- Fix possible |E434| when trying to jump to some help targets.
- Use |execute()| when available to avoid possible issues with
  potentially nested calls to |:redir|.
- Fix conflict with vim-cool plugin (#354).
- Close match listing after buffer deletion to avoid likely errors on
  subsequent interactions (#357, patch from Andrius Grabauskas).
- Fix |E116| error opening filenames containing single quotes.
- Deal with |'wildignore'| (and |g:CommandTWildIgnore|) patterns of the form
  "*pattern" (eg. "*~", which would ignore files created with Vim's default
  |'backupext'|) (#369, patch from Steve Herrell).
- Turn off |'signcolumn'| in the match listing (#376).
- Teach file scanner to skip over badly encoded strings.
- Teach watchman scanner to tolerate broken watchman installation.

5.0.3 (19 September 2018) ~

- Fix unlisted buffers showing up in |:CommandTBuffer| listing on Neovim.
- Fix edge cases with opening selections in tabs (#315).
- Fix possible degenerate performance of |:CommandTBuffer| and
  |:CommandTMRU| on Neovim.
- Handle missing match listing buffer in Neovim (#342).

5.0.2 (7 September 2017) ~

- Fix a RangeError on 64-bit Windows (#304, patch from Adrian Keet).
- Fix issue switching back to previously opened file in another tab (#306).
- Fix inability to open some help targets with |:CommandTHelp| (#307).
- Similar to #307, make |:CommandTCommand| work with commands containing
  special characters.
- Again similar to #307, prevent special characters in tags from being escaped
  when using |:CommandTTag|.

5.0.1 (18 August 2017) ~

- Fixed inability to open a top-level file with a name matching a previously
  opened file (#295).
- Fixed a related issue where previously opened file would cause a file to be
  opened directly rather than in the desired split/tab (#298).
- Tweaked <c-w> mapping behavior to better match what other readline-ish
  implementations do, especially with respect to moving past punctuation
  (#301).

5.0 (6 June 2017) ~

- Command-T now uses |:map-<nowait>|, when available, when setting up mappings.
- 'wildignore' filtering is now always performed by producing an equivalent
  regular expression and applying that; previously this only happened with
  the "watchman" file scanner (includes a bug fix from Henric Trotzig).
- Fixed mis-memoization of |:CommandTHelp| and |:CommandTJump| finders
  (whichever one you used first would be used for both).
- Added mapping (<C-d>) to delete a buffer from the buffer list (patch from
  Max Timkovich).
- Added |g:CommandTGitIncludeUntracked| option (patch from Steven Stallion).
- Added |:CommandTOpen|, which implements smart "goto or open" functionality,
  and adjust |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionCommand|,
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabCommand|,
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionSplitCommand|, and
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVSplitCommand| to use it by default. Their default
  values have been changed from "e", "tabe", "sp" and "vs" to "CommandTOpen
  e", "CommandTOpen tabe", "CommandTOpen sp" and "CommandTOpen vs",
  respectively. Use with |'switchbuf'| set to "usetab" for maximum effect.
- Added |g:CommandTWindowFilter| for customizing the filtering expression that
  is used to determine which windows Command-T should not open selected
  files in.

4.0 (16 May 2016) ~

- A non-leading dot in the search query can now match against dot-files and
  "dot-directories" in non-leading path components.
- Matching algorithm sped up by about 17x (with help from Hanson Wang).
- |g:CommandTInputDebounce| now defaults to 0, as the recent optimizations
  make debouncing largely unnecessary.
- Added |:CommandTHelp| for jumping to locations in the help, and an
  accompanying mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTHelp)|.
- Added |:CommandTLine| for jumping to lines within the current buffer, and a
  corresponding mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTLine)|.
- Added |:CommandTHistory| for jumping to previously entered commands, and a
  corresponding mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTHistory)|.
- Added |:CommandTSearch| for jumping to previously entered searches, and a
  corresponding mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTSearch)|.
- Added |:CommandTCommand| for finding commands, and a corresponding mapping,
  |<Plug>(CommandTCommand)|.
- Added |<Plug>(CommandTMRU)| and |<Plug>(CommandTTag)| mappings.
- The "ruby" and "find" scanners now show numerical progress in the prompt
  area during their scans.
- Removed functionality that was previously deprecated in 2.0.
- Fix inability to type "^" and "|" at the prompt.
- Make it possible to completely disable |'wildignore'|-based filtering by
  setting |g:CommandTWildIgnore| to an empty string.
- The "watchman" file scanner now respects |'wildignore'| and
  |g:CommandTWildIgnore| by constructing an equivalent regular expression and
  using that for filtering.
- Show a warning when hitting |g:CommandTMaxFiles|, and add a corresponding
  |g:CommandTSuppressMaxFilesWarning| setting to suppress the warning.

3.0.2 (9 February 2016) ~

- Minimize flicker on opening and closing the match listing in MacVim.
- Add |CommandTWillShowMatchListing| and |CommandTDidHideMatchListing| "User"
  autocommands.

3.0.1 (25 January 2016) ~

- restore compatibility with Ruby 1.8.7.

3.0 (19 January 2016) ~

- change |g:CommandTIgnoreSpaces| default value to 1.
- change |g:CommandTMatchWindowReverse| default value to 1.
- change |g:CommandTMaxHeight| default value to 15.

- add |:CommandTIgnoreSpaces| option (patch from KJ Tsanaktsidis)
- make Command-T resilient to people deleting its hidden, unlisted buffer
- the match listing buffer now has filetype "command-t", which may be useful
  for detectability/extensibility
- Command-T now sets the name of the match listing buffer according to how it
  was invoked (ie. for the file finder, the name is "Command-T [Files]", for
  the buffer finder, the name is "Command-T [Buffers]", and so on);
  previously the name was a fixed as "GoToFile" regardless of the active
  finder type
- Many internal function names have changed, so if you or your plug-ins are
  calling those internals they will need to be updated:
  - `commandt#CommandTFlush()` is now `commandt#Flush()`
  - `commandt#CommandTLoad()` is now `commandt#Load()`

  - `commandt#CommandTShowTagFinder()` is now `commandt#TagFinder()`
- A number of functions have been turned into "private" autoloaded functions,
  to make it clear that they are intended only for internal use:
  - `CommandTAcceptSelection()` is now `commandt#private#AcceptSelection()`
  - `CommandTAcceptSelectionSplit()` is now `commandt#private#AcceptSelectionSplit()`
  - `CommandTAcceptSelectionTab()` is now `commandt#private#AcceptSelectionTab()`

  from Daniel Hahler)
- skip set-up of |<Esc>| key mapping on rxvt terminals (patch from Daniel
  Hahler)
- add |g:CommandTGitScanSubmodules| option, which can be used to recursively
  scan submodules when the "git" file scanner is used (patch from Ben Boeckel)
- fix for not falling back to "find"-based scanner when a Watchman-related
  error occurs

1.11.4 (4 November 2014) ~

- fix infinite loop on Windows when |g:CommandTTraverseSCM| is set to a value
  other than "pwd" (bug present since 1.11)
- handle unwanted split edgecase when |'hidden'| is set, the current buffer is

  1.1b

1.1b (26 March 2011) ~

- add |:CommandTBuffer| command for quickly selecting among open buffers

1.0.1 (5 January 2011) ~

- work around bug when mapping |:CommandTFlush|, wherein the default mapping
  for |:CommandT| would not be set up
- clean up when leaving the Command-T buffer via unexpected means (such as
  with <C-W k> or similar)

1.0 (26 November 2010) ~

- make relative path simplification work on Windows

1.0b (5 November 2010) ~

- work around platform-specific Vim 7.3 bug seen by some users (wherein
  Vim always falsely reports to Ruby that the buffer numbers is 0)
- re-use the buffer that is used to show the match listing, rather than
  throwing it away and recreating it each time Command-T is shown; this
  stops the buffer numbers from creeping up needlessly

0.9 (8 October 2010) ~

- use relative paths when opening files inside the current working directory
  in order to keep buffer listings as brief as possible (patch from Matthew
  Todd)

0.8.1 (14 September 2010) ~

- fix mapping issues for users who have set |'notimeout'| (patch from Sung
  Pae)

0.8 (19 August 2010) ~

- overrides for the default mappings can now be lists of strings, allowing
  multiple mappings to be defined for any given action
- <Leader>t mapping only set up if no other map for |:CommandT| exists
  (patch from Scott Bronson)
- prevent folds from appearing in the match listing
- tweaks to avoid the likelihood of "Not enough room" errors when trying to
  open files
- watch out for "nil" windows when restoring window dimensions
- optimizations (avoid some repeated downcasing)
- move all Ruby files under the "command-t" subdirectory and avoid polluting
  the "Vim" module namespace

0.8b (11 July 2010) ~

- large overhaul of the scoring algorithm to make the ordering of returned
  results more intuitive; given the scope of the changes and room for
  optimization of the new algorithm, this release is labelled as "beta"

0.7 (10 June 2010) ~

- handle more |'wildignore'| patterns by delegating to Vim's own |expand()|
  function; with this change it is now viable to exclude patterns such as
  'vendor/rails/**' in addition to filename-only patterns like '*.o' and
  '.git' (patch from Mike Lundy)
- always sort results alphabetically for empty search strings; this eliminates
  filesystem-specific variations (patch from Mike Lundy)

0.6 (28 April 2010) ~

- |:CommandT| now accepts an optional parameter to specify the starting
  directory, temporarily overriding the usual default of Vim's |:pwd|
- fix truncated paths when operating from root directory

0.5.1 (11 April 2010) ~

- fix for Ruby 1.9 compatibility regression introduced in 0.5
- documentation enhancements, specifically targetted at Windows users

0.5 (3 April 2010) ~

- provide settings for overriding default mappings
- minor performance optimization

  match window (patch from Lucas de Vries)
- fix bug where |'list'| setting might be inappropriately set after dismissing
  Command-T
- compatibility fix for different behaviour of "autoload" under Ruby 1.9.1
- avoid "highlight group not found" warning when run under a version of Vim
  that does not have syntax highlighting support
- open in split when opening normally would fail due to |'hidden'| and
  |'modified'| values

0.2 (23 March 2010) ~

- compatibility fixes for compilation under Ruby 1.9 series
- compatibility fixes for compilation under Ruby 1.8.5
- compatibility fixes for Windows and other non-UNIX platforms
- suppress "mapping already exists" message if <Leader>t mapping is already
  defined when plug-in is loaded
- exclude paths based on |'wildignore'| setting rather than a hardcoded
  regular expression
